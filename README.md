# Overview

Genpathmaps is a conversion and diagnostic tool for Battlefield pathfinding files

## Changes (by HDN)

Makefile has been replaced with cmake. I have no buisiness working on cmake files (or C for that matter), so I offer no warranties that the compiled executable won't blow up your computer.

## Building

```bash
cmake .
cmake --build .
```
